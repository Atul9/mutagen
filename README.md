# Breaking your Rust code for fun & profit

This is a work in progress mutation testing framework. The idea behind
mutation testing is to insert changes into your code to see if they
make your tests fail. If not, your tests obviously fail to test the
changed code.

This repo has two components at the moment: A helper library and a
procedural macro that mutates your code.

issues and PRs welcome!
